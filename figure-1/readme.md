# Figure 1: Resolution comparison
As this is a simulation designed to validate the code and its invariance in results above a certain resolution a bootstrap and plotting file will be included instead, as the resolution for these simulations is much higher, this will take some time.

# Guide
- Run `bootstrap-fig1.sh`, to generate and initialise the simulations, this should take a few seconds
- Run `runall.sh`, ideally in a `screen` process, this should take a week
- Run `plot-fig1.py` if you want to verify the data visually against the plot in figure 1 of our paper
