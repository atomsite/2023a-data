# Figures 8, 9 & 10: Core model parameter space search
This is a very large simulation set which uses the core model for 60Fe distribution.
Run the `bootstrap-fig-8-10.sh` script to generate the simulations, or extract and run the code in `plot_data_0.25.tar.xz` or `plot_data_0.50.tar.xz` to extract the results for each core size.
