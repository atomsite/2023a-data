# Figure 4, core model comparison for water fraction over time
As with figure 3, I have just included the data for each simulation, as these results are generated from the `hydrous_silicates.t3c` file for each simulation. The simulations can be generated using the `bootstrap-fig4.sh` script included, and run with `runall.sh` (these simulations should run in a week, so use a `screen` process).

If you simply want the data, decompress `plot_data.tar.xz`, there is also a plotting script.
